# ROC-AUC-Curve
The area under the ROC curve (AUC) represents the probability that the model, if given a randomly chosen positive and negative example, will rank the positive higher than the negative. The perfect model above, containing a square with sides of length 1, has an area under the curve (AUC) of 1.0.
